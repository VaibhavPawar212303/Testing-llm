Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.\n\nExample:\nExample text: \nOur new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"statements\": [\n        \"The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.\",\n        \"It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.\",\n        \"Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.\",\n        \"Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.\",\n        \"24/7 customer support is included.\"\n    ]\n}\n===== END OF EXAMPLE ======\n        \n**\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the \"statements\" key mapping to a list of strings.

In this case, the timeout exceeded.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we can increase the wait time or use a more efficient locator strategy (e.g., `getByRole` instead of `getByText`). Additionally, we should consider adding some auto-waiting to ensure that Playwright waits until all elements are visible before making assertions.\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** Navigation/Assertion\n\nJSON:\n",
