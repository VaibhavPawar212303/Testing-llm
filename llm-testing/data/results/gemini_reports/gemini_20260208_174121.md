Text:
**Playwright Test Failure Analysis**

**Summary:** The test failed to locate an element using the "getByRole" locator strategy.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The locator click operation timed out after 30 seconds, causing the assertion `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` to fail due to a timeout error.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
```javascript
const { Page } = require("playwright");

(async () => {
  const browser = await new Promise((resolve) => globalThis.setTimeout(resolve, 30000));
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  // Navigate to the test page
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  
  // Locate an element using role-based locator strategy
  const element = await page.locator(ByRole("button"));
  
  // Click on the element and wait for its visibility
  await element.click().then(() => {
    expect(await element).toBeVisible();
  });
  
  browser.close();
})();
```
**SEVERITY:** High

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Navigation/Locator/Assertion
