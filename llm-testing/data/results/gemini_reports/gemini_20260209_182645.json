Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.\n\nExample:\nExample text: \nOur new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"statements\": [\n        \"The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.\",\n        \"It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.\",\n        \"Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.\",\n        \"Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.\",\n        \"24/7 customer support is included.\"\n    ]\n}\n===== END OF EXAMPLE ======\n        \n**\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the \"statements\" key mapping to a list of strings. No words or explanation are needed. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.\n**\n\nText:\nHere is a sample test that I've analyzed using the given format:\n\n**SUMMARY:** The test failed because it was unable to locate an element with the id \"myElement\" on the page.\n\n**ROOT_CAUSE:** The locator strategy \"getByTestId\" used in the test failed. This locator type requires a unique test ID for each element, which is not provided in this case. Instead, a role-based locator (\"getByRole\") was used to locate an element with the role of \"button\".\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Replace the `getByTestId` locator with a `getByText` locator that can be more robust and flexible when dealing with dynamic content or multiple elements.\n\nSpecific code fix:\n\n```javascript\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest('should display message', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  const button = await page.$$('.myElement');\n  expect(button).toBeVisible();\n});\n```\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** Locator, Assertion\n\nJSON:\n",
