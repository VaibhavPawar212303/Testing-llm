Text:
**Summary:** The test failed to verify that the login button is enabled on a webpage.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** Locator-based assertion for `getByRole("edit")` fails because it does not specify any locator strategy, resulting in undefined behavior.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use either `role` or `text` locator strategy for `getByRole("edit")` to enable the login button. Here's an example of using `role` strategy:

```javascript
const loginButton = await page.locator.getByRole('edit').click();
```

If you want to verify that the login button is enabled, you can use `expect` statement with a helper function like this:

```javascript
async function isLoginButtonEnabled() {
    const loginButton = await page.locator.getByRole('edit');
    return expect(loginButton).toBeEnabled();
}

isLoginButtonEnabled().then(isEnabled => {
    if (isEnabled) {
        console.log("Login button is enabled");
    } else {
        console.log("Login button is not enabled");
    }
});
```

**SEVERITY:** High
