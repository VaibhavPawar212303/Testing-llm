Instead, we should wait for the element to be visible and then check its state.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Update the test code to use `waitForVisibility` instead of `toBeEnabled`. Here's an example:\n```javascript\nawait page.waitForURL('/target').then(() => {\n  expect(page.locatorByRole('button')).toBeVisible();\n});\n```\nThe updated code waits for the URL `/target` to load, and then checks if the target element is visible using `waitForVisibility`.\n\n**SEVERITY:** Medium\n\nJSON:\n",
