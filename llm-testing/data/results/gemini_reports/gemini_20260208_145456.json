Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.\n\nExample:\nExample text: \nOur new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"statements\": [\n        \"The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.\",\n        \"It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.\",\n        \"Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.\",\n        \"Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.\",\n        \"24/7 customer support is included.\"\n    ]\n}\n===== END OF EXAMPLE ======\n        \n**\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the \"statements\" key mapping to a list of strings.

This is likely due to an older browser or a network issue preventing the script from waiting for the element to load.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** I will update the `waitForLoadState` assertion to use `waitForvisibility` instead of `loadState`, as it provides more accurate results in such cases. Specifically, this change can be made by updating the line:\n\n```javascript\nexpect(element).toBeVisible();\n```\n\nto\n\n```javascript\nexpect(element).waitForVisibility();\n```\nAdditionally, I will verify that the element is not loading before attempting to access it.\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** User Settings > General\n\nHere's an updated test with the recommended changes:\n\n```javascript\ndescribe('User Settings page', () => {\n  beforeEach(async () => {\n    await login();\n  });\n\n  afterEach(async () => {\n    await logout();\n  });\n\n  it('should log in to the dashboard', async () => {\n    // Navigate to user settings page\n    await navigateTo('/user');\n\n    // Wait for element to be visible and loaded\n    const element = await waitForVisibility(\n      '.login-form',\n      'Username and password input fields'\n    );\n\n    // Log in with valid credentials\n    await logIn('username', 'password');\n\n    // Verify that the login was successful\n    expect(element).toBeVisible();\n    expect(await element.getText()).toContain('Logged in successfully!');\n  });\n});\n```\nNote: The `waitForVisibility` function is used instead of `waitForLoadState` to ensure that the element is visible before attempting to access it. This is a more accurate approach when dealing with older browsers or network issues preventing the script from waiting for the element to load.\n\nJSON:\n",
