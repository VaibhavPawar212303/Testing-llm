## 📝 Prompt

```
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Expected JSON format:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_irrelevance>,
            "verdict": "no"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_ambiguity>,
            "verdict": "idk"
        }
    ]  
}

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
**          

Input:
Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

Statements:
['Test failed to log in to the dashboard after navigating to the user settings page.', 'The `waitForLoadState` assertion timed out, indicating that the element was not loaded within 30 seconds.', 'This is likely due to an older browser or a network issue preventing the script from waiting for the element to load.', 'I will update the `waitForLoadState` assertion to use `waitForvisibility` instead of `loadState`, as it provides more accurate results in such cases.', 'Specifically, this change can be made by updating the line: `expect(element).toBeVisible();` to `expect(element).waitForVisibility();`', 'Additionally, I will verify that the element is not loading before attempting to access it.', 'The `waitForVisibility` function is used instead of `waitForLoadState` to ensure that the element is visible before attempting to access it.']

JSON:

## 📊 Response

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The statement discusses a timeout error and a potential solution (using `waitForVisibility` instead of `waitForLoadState`) to address the issue. It also highlights the need to verify element visibility before accessing it, which is directly related to the problem."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The statement explicitly mentions updating the `waitForLoadState` assertion to use `waitForVisibility` to handle timeouts. This is a direct action taken to resolve the timeout issue."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk",
            "reason": "The statement describes a potential cause (older browser or network issue) but doesn't provide a specific solution or explanation. It's an informational statement about a possible problem, but not directly addressing the error itself."
        }
    ]
}
