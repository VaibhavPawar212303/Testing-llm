Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.\n\nExample:\nExample text: \nOur new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"statements\": [\n        \"The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.\",\n        \"It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.\",\n        \"Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.\",\n        \"Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.\",\n        \"24/7 customer support is included.\"\n    ]\n}\n===== END OF EXAMPLE ======\n        \n**\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the \"statements\" key mapping to a list of strings. No words or explanation are needed. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.\n**\n\nText:\n**Summary:** The test failed to verify that the login button is enabled on a webpage.\n\n**ROOT_CAUSE:** Locator-based assertion for `getByRole(\"edit\")` fails because it does not specify any locator strategy, resulting in undefined behavior.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Use either `role` or `text` locator strategy for `getByRole(\"edit\")` to enable the login button. Here's an example of using `role` strategy:\n\n```javascript\nconst loginButton = await page.locator.getByRole('edit').click();\n```\n\nIf you want to verify that the login button is enabled, you can use `expect` statement with a helper function like this:\n\n```javascript\nasync function isLoginButtonEnabled() {\n    const loginButton = await page.locator.getByRole('edit');\n    return expect(loginButton).toBeEnabled();\n}\n\nisLoginButtonEnabled().then(isEnabled => {\n    if (isEnabled) {\n        console.log(\"Login button is enabled\");\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Login button is not enabled\");\n    }\n});\n```\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\nJSON:\n",
