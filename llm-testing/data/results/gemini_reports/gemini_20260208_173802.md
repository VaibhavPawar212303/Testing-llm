## 📝 Prompt

```
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Expected JSON format:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_irrelevance>,
            "verdict": "no"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_ambiguity>,
            "verdict": "idk"
        }
    ]  
}

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
**          

Input:
Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

Statements:
['Playwright Test Failure Analysis is the title of the text.', 'Unable to locate an element with a specific test ID using the getByTestId locator strategy.', "The 'waitFor' function was not waiting for the page to load and stabilize before attempting to locate the element.", "To fix this issue, we need to add a wait() call after the page has loaded and stabilized before attempting to locate the element using the 'waitFor' function.", "The fix involves creating a new page instance and navigating to the test URL using 'waitFor'. Then, inside the 'waitFor' callback, we locate the element with the specified test ID using 'locator()'. Finally, we wait for the element to become visible before returning it."]

JSON:

## 📊 Response

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The error message directly addresses a timeout issue, which is a common problem when waiting for elements to load."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The statements discuss different approaches to fixing the timeout, such as adding a 'waitFor' call and using 'locator()'."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk",
            "reason": "The statement discusses the 'waitFor' function and its use, but doesn't explicitly relate to the timeout error."
        }
    ]
}
