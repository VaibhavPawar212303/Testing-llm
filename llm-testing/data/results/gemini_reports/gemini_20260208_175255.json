It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.

This is because the role \"loginButton\" was not added as an attribute to the element in the HTML.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we need to add the \"loginButton\" role attribute to the login button element or use a different locator strategy that can handle missing elements.\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** Navigation (Login Button)\n\nJSON:\n",
