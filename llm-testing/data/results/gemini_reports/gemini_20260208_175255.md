**Playwright Test Failure Analysis**

**SUMMARY:** The test failed to verify that the login button is clickable because it was not present on the page.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `getByRole` locator strategy was used to find a role, but it did not match any roles. This is because the role "loginButton" was not added as an attribute to the element in the HTML.

**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we need to add the "loginButton" role attribute to the login button element or use a different locator strategy that can handle missing elements.

**SEVERITY:** High

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Navigation (Login Button)
