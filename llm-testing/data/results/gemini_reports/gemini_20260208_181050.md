Example text: 
Our new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.

Text:
**Analysis of Playwright Test Failure**

**SUMMARY:** The test failed due to an infinite loop in the `waitForLoadState` method.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `waitForLoadState` method was not waiting for a sufficient amount of time, causing it to continuously retry, resulting in an infinite loop. This is caused by the incorrect use of the `waitForLoadState` method and its timeout configuration.

**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we need to increase the timeout value passed to `waitForLoadState`. We can do this by changing the following line:
```javascript
const page = await page.waitForLoadState({ timeout: 30000 });
```
to:
```javascript
const page = await page.waitForLoadState({ timeout: 50000 });
```
This will give the locator sufficient time to complete, breaking the infinite loop and allowing the test to pass.

**SEVERITY:** High
