## 📝 Prompt

```
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Expected JSON format:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_irrelevance>,
            "verdict": "no"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_ambiguity>,
            "verdict": "idk"
        }
    ]  
}

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
**          

Input:
Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

Statements:
["Ollama Error: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8000): Max retries exceeded with url: /playwright", 'The error indicates a connection refused issue.', 'The error message suggests a network problem or server unavailability.', 'The error occurs when attempting to connect to the Ollama server.', 'The error is caused by a connection refused error.']

JSON:

## 📊 Response

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The statement directly addresses the timeout error, indicating a problem with the server or network connection."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The statement discusses a connection refused error, which is a separate issue unrelated to the timeout."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk",
            "reason": "The statement describes a network problem, but doesn't explicitly state whether it's related to the timeout. Further context is needed."
        }
    ]
}
