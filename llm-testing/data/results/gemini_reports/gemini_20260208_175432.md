## 📝 Prompt

```
Given the text, breakdown and generate a list of statements presented. Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.

Example:
Example text: 
Our new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.



{
    "statements": [
        "The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.",
        "It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.",
        "Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.",
        "Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.",
        "24/7 customer support is included."
    ]
}

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the "statements" key mapping to a list of strings. No words or explanation are needed. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Text:
Here's a test failure analysis in the required format:

**SUMMARY:** The assertion `expect(element).toBeVisible()` failed to detect an element on the page because it was not visible.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The reason for this failure is that Playwright is waiting for too long before detecting the element. In this case, the timeout exceeded.

**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we can increase the wait time or use a more efficient locator strategy (e.g., `getByRole` instead of `getByText`). Additionally, we should consider adding some auto-waiting to ensure that Playwright waits until all elements are visible before making assertions.

**SEVERITY:** High

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Navigation/Assertion
