## 📝 Prompt

```
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Expected JSON format:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_irrelevance>,
            "verdict": "no"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_ambiguity>,
            "verdict": "idk"
        }
    ]  
}

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
**          

Input:
Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

Statements:
["The test failed due to an assertion error on element 'target'.", "The 'expect' statement 'toBeEnabled()' was used to assert that the target element is enabled, but it's not possible to enable a non-existing element using Playwright.", 'Instead, we should wait for the element to be visible and then check its state.', "The updated code waits for the URL '/target' to load, and then checks if the target element is visible using 'waitForVisibility'.", "Here's an example: 'await page.waitForURL('/target').then(() => { expect(page.locatorByRole('button')).toBeVisible(); });'"]

JSON:

```

## 📊 Response

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The error message directly addresses the timeout issue, indicating a problem with the selector 'text=Welcome'."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The statements discuss different approaches to handling the timeout, such as waiting for element visibility, rather than directly addressing the timeout itself."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk",
            "reason": "The statements are about different techniques for dealing with timeouts, but don't provide a clear explanation of why the timeout is occurring."
        }
    ]
}
