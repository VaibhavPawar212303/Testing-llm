## 📝 Prompt

```
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Expected JSON format:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_irrelevance>,
            "verdict": "no"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_ambiguity>,
            "verdict": "idk"
        }
    ]  
}

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
**          

Input:
Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

Statements:
["The test failed to locate an element using the 'getByRole' locator strategy.", "The locator click operation timed out after 30 seconds, causing the assertion 'expect(locator).toBeVisible()' to fail due to a timeout error.", 'The root cause is a timeout error during the locator click operation.', "The recommended solution involves using a different locator strategy like 'ByXpath' or 'ByCSS'.", 'The severity of the issue is high due to the test failure.', 'The affected area is navigation/locator/assertion.', 'The severity of the issue is high due to the test failure.', 'The severity of the issue is high due to the test failure.', 'The severity of the issue is high due to the test failure.', 'The severity of the issue is high due to the test failure.']

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The error message directly addresses a timeout issue, which is a relevant concern for test failures."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The statements discuss different locator strategies, not the specific timeout error."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk",
            "reason": "The statement describes a timeout error but doesn't provide context about the test failure or the specific issue."
        }
    ]
}
