## 📝 Prompt

```
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Expected JSON format:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_irrelevance>,
            "verdict": "no"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_ambiguity>,
            "verdict": "idk"
        }
    ]  
}

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
**          

Input:
Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

Statements:
['The test failed to verify that the login button is clickable.', 'The login button was not present on the page.', "The 'getByRole' locator strategy failed because the role 'loginButton' was not added as an attribute to the element.", "To fix this issue, we need to add the 'loginButton' role attribute to the login button element or use a different locator strategy.", 'The affected area is Navigation (Login Button).']

JSON:

## 📊 Response

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The error message directly addresses a timeout issue related to a selector ('text=Welcome')."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The statements discuss login button functionality and its presence, but don't relate to the timeout error."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk",
            "reason": "The statement discusses the 'loginButton' role attribute, but doesn't explain the timeout issue."
        }
    ]
}
