```
Given the text, breakdown and generate a list of statements presented. Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.

Example:
Example text: 
Our new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.



{
    "statements": [
        "The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.",
        "It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.",
        "Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.",
        "Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.",
        "24/7 customer support is included."
    ]

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the "statements" key mapping to a list of strings. No words or explanation are needed. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Text:
Here is a sample test that I've analyzed using the given format:

**SUMMARY:** The test failed because it was unable to locate an element with the id "myElement" on the page.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The locator strategy "getByTestId" used in the test failed. This locator type requires a unique test ID for each element, which is not provided in this case. Instead, a role-based locator ("getByRole") was used to locate an element with the role of "button".

**RECOMMENDATION:** Replace the `getByTestId` locator with a `getByText` locator that can be more robust and flexible when dealing with dynamic content or multiple elements.

Specific code fix:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should display message', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const button = await page.$$('.myElement');
  expect(button).toBeVisible();
});
```

**SEVERITY:** High

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Locator, Assertion
