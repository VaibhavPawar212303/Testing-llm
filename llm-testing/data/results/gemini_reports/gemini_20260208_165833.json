Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.\n\nExample:\nExample text: \nOur new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"statements\": [\n        \"The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.\",\n        \"It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.\",\n        \"Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.\",\n        \"Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.\",\n        \"24/7 customer support is included.\"\n    ]\n}\n===== END OF EXAMPLE ======\n        \n**\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the \"statements\" key mapping to a list of strings.

Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.\n**\n\nText:\n**Analysis of Playwright Test Failure**\n\n**SUMMARY:** The test failed because the page was navigated to without waiting for all elements to be loaded.\n\n**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `waitForLoadState` locator click on an element with id \"myButton\" resulted in a timeout error due to insufficient wait time. The script attempted to click on the button before all its ancestors were loaded, causing the browser to exit the load state.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, you can use `waitForLoadState` along with `waitForTimeout` to ensure that all elements are loaded before attempting to interact with them. You can also consider using a more robust locator strategy like `getByTestId` which is specifically designed for selecting by test IDs.\n\n**SEVERITY:** Medium\n\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** Page navigation, Locator strategy\n\nJSON:\n",
