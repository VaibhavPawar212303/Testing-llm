Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.\n\nExample:\nExample text: \nOur new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"statements\": [\n        \"The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.\",\n        \"It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.\",\n        \"Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.\",\n        \"Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.\",\n        \"24/7 customer support is included.\"\n    ]\n}\n===== END OF EXAMPLE ======\n        \n**\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the \"statements\" key mapping to a list of strings.

Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.\n**\n\nText:\n**Analysis of Playwright Test Failure**\n\n**SUMMARY:** The test failed due to a timeout error when trying to click on an element with the locator \"getByRole('role-name')\".\n\n**ROOT_CAUSE:** The locator \"getByRole('role-name')\" is using a role-based strategy, which can lead to slower performance and increased timeout limits. When the browser navigates away or closes the page before the expected time to perform the action, the test times out.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we need to increase the timeout limit for the locator \"getByRole('role-name')\" to a value that allows the browser enough time to navigate away from the element. We can do this by setting the `timeout` property of the locator to 50000ms.\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** Locator-based navigation, Assertion failures\n\nJSON:\n",
