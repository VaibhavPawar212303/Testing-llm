Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.\n\nExample:\nExample text: \nOur new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"statements\": [\n        \"The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.\",\n        \"It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.\",\n        \"Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.\",\n        \"Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.\",\n        \"24/7 customer support is included.\"\n    ]\n}\n===== END OF EXAMPLE ======\n        \n**\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the \"statements\" key mapping to a list of strings.

Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.\n**\n\nText:\n**Test Failure Analysis**\n\n**Summary:** The test failed to render the page because of an assertion failure.\n\n**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `expect` statement on element `#button-123` is failing because it doesn't have a visible text content.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Use the `toBeVisible()` method instead of `toBe()`. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```javascript\nexpect(await page.getByLabel(\"#button-123\").then((button) => button.textContent)).toBe(\"Click me\");\n```\n\nThis will wait for the element to be visible and then assert that its text content is \"Click me\".\n\nJSON:\n",
