It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.

Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.\n**\n\nText:\n**Analysis of Playwright Test Failure**\n\n**SUMMARY:** The test failed due to an infinite loop in the `waitForLoadState` method.\n\n**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `waitForLoadState` method was not waiting for a sufficient amount of time, causing it to continuously retry, resulting in an infinite loop. This is caused by the incorrect use of the `waitForLoadState` method and its timeout configuration.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we need to increase the timeout value passed to `waitForLoadState`. We can do this by changing the following line:\n```javascript\nconst page = await page.waitForLoadState({ timeout: 30000 });\n```\nto:\n```javascript\nconst page = await page.waitForLoadState({ timeout: 50000 });\n```\nThis will give the locator sufficient time to complete, breaking the infinite loop and allowing the test to pass.\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\nJSON:\n",
