Ambiguous statements and single words can be considered as statements, but only if outside of a coherent statement.\n\nExample:\nExample text: \nOur new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"statements\": [\n        \"The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.\",\n        \"It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.\",\n        \"Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.\",\n        \"Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.\",\n        \"24/7 customer support is included.\"\n    ]\n}\n===== END OF EXAMPLE ======\n        \n**\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the \"statements\" key mapping to a list of strings.

This caused the test to fail immediately, without allowing the elements to fully render and become visible.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to use a more robust locator strategy that can wait for the page to load and become stable before asserting element visibility. In this case, we can use `waitForLoadState` with a timeout of 30 seconds.\n\nSEVERITY: High\n\nAFFECTED_AREA: Navigation ( clicking on an element with role \"button\" )\n\nCorrected code:\n```javascript\nconst { test } = require('@playwright/test');\nconst browser = await test.context.launch();\n\ntest.context.run(async ({ context }) => {\n  const page = await context.newPage();\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n\n  // Click on an element with role \"button\"\n  await page.click('#myButton');\n\n  // Wait for the page to finish loading and become stable\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle3');\n  await page.waitForTimeout(30000);\n\n  const button = await page.locator('#myButton');\n  expect(button).toBeVisible();\n});\n```\nNote: Make sure to replace `#myButton` with the actual element ID or locator of the button in your test.\n\nJSON:\n",
