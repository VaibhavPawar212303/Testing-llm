Example text: 
Our new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, we’ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.

Text:
**Test Failure Analysis**

**Summary:** The test failed to render the page because of an assertion failure.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `expect` statement on element `#button-123` is failing because it doesn't have a visible text content.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use the `toBeVisible()` method instead of `toBe()`. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
expect(await page.getByLabel("#button-123").then((button) => button.textContent)).toBe("Click me");
```

This will wait for the element to be visible and then assert that its text content is "Click me".
