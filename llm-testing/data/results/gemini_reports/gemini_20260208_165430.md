## 📝 Prompt

```
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Expected JSON format:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_irrelevance>,
            "verdict": "no"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_ambiguity>,
            "verdict": "idk"
        }
    ]  
}

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
**          

Input:
Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

Statements:
['Failed test due to navigation issue after clicking on an element with role "button".', "The test failed because the 'click' method of the clicked element was not waiting for the page to finish loading before asserting its visibility.", 'We need to use a more robust locator strategy that can wait for the page to load and become stable before asserting element visibility.', "Using 'waitForLoadState' with a timeout of 30 seconds can fix this issue.", "The corrected code uses 'page.waitForLoadState('networkidle3')' to wait for the page to finish loading and become stable.", "The corrected code uses 'page.waitForTimeout(30000)' to wait for 30 seconds after the page loads.", "The element with ID 'myButton' is expected to be visible after the page loads.", "The test verifies that the element with ID 'myButton' is visible after the page loads.", "The test confirms that the element with ID 'myButton' is visible after a 30-second wait."]

## 📊 Response

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The error message directly addresses a timeout issue, indicating a problem with the page loading process.  The suggested solutions (waitForLoadState, page.waitForTimeout, page.waitForLoadState('networkidle3')) are designed to address this."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The statements discuss different strategies for handling the timeout, such as using a locator strategy and waiting for the page to load.  They don't directly relate to the timeout error itself."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk",
            "reason": "The statement discusses a timeout issue but doesn't provide specific details about the cause or how it's being addressed.  It's a general observation about the error."
        }
    ]
}
