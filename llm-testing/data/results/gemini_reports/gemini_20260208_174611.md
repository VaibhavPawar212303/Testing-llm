## 📝 Prompt

```
For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Generate JSON objects with 'verdict' and 'reason' fields.
The 'verdict' should be 'yes' (relevant), 'no' (irrelevant), or 'idk' (ambiguous/supporting information).
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
The statements are from an AI's actual output.



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in valid and parseable JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Expected JSON format:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_irrelevance>,
            "verdict": "no"
        },
        {
            "reason": <explanation_for_ambiguity>,
            "verdict": "idk"
        }
    ]  
}

Generate ONE verdict per statement - number of 'verdicts' MUST equal number of statements.
'verdict' must be STRICTLY 'yes', 'no', or 'idk':
- 'yes': statement is relevant to addressing the input
- 'no': statement is irrelevant to the input  
- 'idk': statement is ambiguous (not directly relevant but could be supporting information)
Provide 'reason' ONLY for 'no' or 'idk' verdicts.
**          

Input:
Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

Statements:
['The test failed due to a timeout error when trying to click on an element with the locator "getByRole(\'role-name\')".', 'The locator "getByRole(\'role-name\')" uses a role-based strategy, which can lead to slower performance and increased timeout limits.', 'When the browser navigates away or closes the page before the expected time to perform the action, the test times out.', 'We need to increase the timeout limit for the locator "getByRole(\'role-name\')" to a value that allows the browser enough time to navigate away from the element.', "We can do this by setting the 'timeout' property of the locator to 50000ms."]

JSON:

```

## 📊 Response

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The error message directly addresses a timeout issue, which is a common problem when waiting for elements to load or interact with."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The statements discuss different aspects of the error (timeout, locator strategy, timeout limit) but don't directly relate to the specific problem described."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk",
            "reason": "The statements are about different aspects of testing and browser behavior, not the specific timeout error."
        }
    ]
}
