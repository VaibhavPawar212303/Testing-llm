As a result, the element was not found within 30 seconds, causing the timeout error.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we need to add a wait() call after the page has loaded and stabilized before attempting to locate the element using the `waitFor` function.\n\n**CODE FIX:**\n```javascript\nimport { waitFor } from 'playwright';\n\nconst page = await client.newPage();\nawait page.goto('https://example.com');\nawait waitFor(() => {\n  const element = await page.locator('test-id').toBeVisible();\n  return element;\n});\n```\nIn this fix, we create a new page instance and navigate to the test URL using `waitFor`. Then, inside the `waitFor` callback, we locate the element with the specified test ID using `locator()`. Finally, we wait for the element to become visible before returning it.\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** Locator Strategies > Test ID > waitFor()\n\nJSON:\n",
