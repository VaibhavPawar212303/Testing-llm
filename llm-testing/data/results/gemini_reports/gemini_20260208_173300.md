## 📝 Prompt

```
Given the answer relevancy score, the list of reasons of irrelevant statements made in the actual output, and the input, provide a CONCISE reason for the score. Explain why it is not higher, but also why it is at its current score.
The irrelevant statements represent things in the actual output that is irrelevant to addressing whatever is asked/talked about in the input.
If there is nothing irrelevant, just say something positive with an upbeat encouraging tone (but don't overdo it otherwise it gets annoying).



**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'reason' key providing the reason. Ensure all strings are closed appropriately. Repair any invalid JSON before you output it.

Example:
Example JSON:
{
    "reason": "The score is <answer_relevancy_score> because <your_reason>."
}
===== END OF EXAMPLE ======

Answer Relevancy Score:
0.67

Reasons why the score can't be higher based on irrelevant statements in the actual output:
['The statement discusses a failing assertion, unrelated to the timeout error.']

Input:
Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'

JSON:

```

## 📊 Response

{
    "reason": "The response focuses on the timeout error but doesn't offer a specific explanation of the 'text=Welcome' selector, making it less directly relevant to the core issue."
}
