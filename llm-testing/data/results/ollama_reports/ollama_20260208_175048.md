## 📊 Response

**Playwright Test Failure Analysis**

**Summary:** The test failed due to an assertion error on element 'target'.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `expect` statement `toBeEnabled()` was used to assert that the target element is enabled, but it's not possible to enable a non-existing element using Playwright. Instead, we should wait for the element to be visible and then check its state.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Update the test code to use `waitForVisibility` instead of `toBeEnabled`. Here's an example:
```javascript
await page.waitForURL('/target').then(() => {
  expect(page.locatorByRole('button')).toBeVisible();
});
```
The updated code waits for the URL `/target` to load, and then checks if the target element is visible using `waitForVisibility`.

**SEVERITY:** Medium
