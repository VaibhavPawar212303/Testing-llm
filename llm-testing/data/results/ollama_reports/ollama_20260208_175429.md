Explain this error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded while waiting for selector 'text=Welcome'
```

## 📊 Response

Here's a test failure analysis in the required format:

**SUMMARY:** The assertion `expect(element).toBeVisible()` failed to detect an element on the page because it was not visible.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The reason for this failure is that Playwright is waiting for too long before detecting the element. In this case, the timeout exceeded.

**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we can increase the wait time or use a more efficient locator strategy (e.g., `getByRole` instead of `getByText`). Additionally, we should consider adding some auto-waiting to ensure that Playwright waits until all elements are visible before making assertions.

**SEVERITY:** High

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Navigation/Assertion
