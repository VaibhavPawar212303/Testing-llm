## 📊 Response

**Analysis of Playwright Test Failure**

**SUMMARY:** The test failed because the page was navigated to without waiting for all elements to be loaded.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `waitForLoadState` locator click on an element with id "myButton" resulted in a timeout error due to insufficient wait time. The script attempted to click on the button before all its ancestors were loaded, causing the browser to exit the load state.

**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, you can use `waitForLoadState` along with `waitForTimeout` to ensure that all elements are loaded before attempting to interact with them. You can also consider using a more robust locator strategy like `getByTestId` which is specifically designed for selecting by test IDs.

**SEVERITY:** Medium

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Page navigation, Locator strategy
