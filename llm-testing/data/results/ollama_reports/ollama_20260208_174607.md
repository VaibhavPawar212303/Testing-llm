## 📊 Response

**Analysis of Playwright Test Failure**

**SUMMARY:** The test failed due to a timeout error when trying to click on an element with the locator "getByRole('role-name')".

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The locator "getByRole('role-name')" is using a role-based strategy, which can lead to slower performance and increased timeout limits. When the browser navigates away or closes the page before the expected time to perform the action, the test times out.

**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we need to increase the timeout limit for the locator "getByRole('role-name')" to a value that allows the browser enough time to navigate away from the element. We can do this by setting the `timeout` property of the locator to 50000ms.

**SEVERITY:** High

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Locator-based navigation, Assertion failures
