## 📊 Response

**Playwright Test Failure Analysis**

**Summary:** Unable to locate an element with a specific test ID using the getByTestId locator strategy.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The `waitFor` function was not waiting for the page to load and stabilize before attempting to locate the element. As a result, the element was not found within 30 seconds, causing the timeout error.

**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we need to add a wait() call after the page has loaded and stabilized before attempting to locate the element using the `waitFor` function.

**CODE FIX:**
```javascript
import { waitFor } from 'playwright';

const page = await client.newPage();
await page.goto('https://example.com');
await waitFor(() => {
  const element = await page.locator('test-id').toBeVisible();
  return element;
});
```
In this fix, we create a new page instance and navigate to the test URL using `waitFor`. Then, inside the `waitFor` callback, we locate the element with the specified test ID using `locator()`. Finally, we wait for the element to become visible before returning it.

**SEVERITY:** High

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Locator Strategies > Test ID > waitFor()
