## 📊 Response

Here is a sample test that I've analyzed using the given format:

**SUMMARY:** The test failed because it was unable to locate an element with the id "myElement" on the page.

**ROOT_CAUSE:** The locator strategy "getByTestId" used in the test failed. This locator type requires a unique test ID for each element, which is not provided in this case. Instead, a role-based locator ("getByRole") was used to locate an element with the role of "button".

**RECOMMENDATION:** Replace the `getByTestId` locator with a `getByText` locator that can be more robust and flexible when dealing with dynamic content or multiple elements.

Specific code fix:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should display message', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const button = await page.$$('.myElement');
  expect(button).toBeVisible();
});
```

**SEVERITY:** High

**AFFECTED_AREA:** Locator, Assertion
