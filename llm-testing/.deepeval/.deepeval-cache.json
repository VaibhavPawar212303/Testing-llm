This is likely due to an older browser or a network issue preventing the script from waiting for the element to load.\\n\\n**RECOMMENDATION:** I will update the `waitForLoadState` assertion to use `waitForvisibility` instead of `loadState`, as it provides more accurate results in such cases. Specifically, this change can be made by updating the line:\\n\\n```javascript\\nexpect(element).toBeVisible();\\n```\\n\\nto\\n\\n```javascript\\nexpect(element).waitForVisibility();\\n```\\nAdditionally, I will verify that the element is not loading before attempting to access it.\\n\\n**SEVERITY:** High\\n\\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** User Settings > General\\n\\nHere's an updated test with the recommended changes:\\n\\n```javascript\\ndescribe('User Settings page', () => {\\n  beforeEach(async () => {\\n    await login();\\n  });\\n\\n  afterEach(async () => {\\n    await logout();\\n  });\\n\\n  it('should log in to the dashboard', async () => {\\n    // Navigate to user settings page\\n    await navigateTo('/user');\\n\\n    // Wait for element to be visible and loaded\\n    const element = await waitForVisibility(\\n      '.login-form',\\n      'Username and password input fields'\\n    );\\n\\n    // Log in with valid credentials\\n    await logIn('username', 'password');\\n\\n    // Verify that the login was successful\\n    expect(element).toBeVisible();\\n    expect(await element.getText()).toContain('Logged in successfully!');\\n  });\\n});\\n```\\nNote: The `waitForVisibility` function is used instead of `waitForLoadState` to ensure that the element is visible before attempting to access it.
