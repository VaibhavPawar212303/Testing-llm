In this case, the timeout exceeded.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** To fix this issue, we can increase the wait time or use a more efficient locator strategy (e.g., `getByRole` instead of `getByText`). Additionally, we should consider adding some auto-waiting to ensure that Playwright waits until all elements are visible before making assertions.\n\n**SEVERITY:** High\n\n**AFFECTED_AREA:** Navigation/Assertion", "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.6, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The score is 1.00 because the output directly and accurately explains the error message, detailing the timeout duration and the specific selector causing the issue.
